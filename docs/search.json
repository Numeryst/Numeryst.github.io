    "text": "The Vision: Tech Content for the Curious\nMy goal was simple: to build a small corner of the internet where curious minds could explore computational science and programming in depth. I didn‚Äôt want to chase trends, I wanted to create content that taught, that explained, that experimented.\nPython tutorials. Julia benchmarks. Mojo‚Äôs wild potential. My channel became a personal lab, and an open notebook.\nI‚Äôve always been my own toughest critic, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever published a video that fully meets the standards I imagine. Still, I knew I had to keep creating to improve. There are plenty of topics I haven‚Äôt covered yet, even though they‚Äôve been on my mind for a long time. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm either too lazy or too much of a perfectionist when it comes to really good ideas and topics."

    "section": "When Smart Audiences Make Content Harder",
    "text": "When Smart Audiences Make Content Harder\nSome of my early videos on the Julia programming language went viral on YouTube, which brought in a lot of subscribers interested in similar content. But here‚Äôs the thing about people who follow scientific programming, they‚Äôre incredibly smart. We‚Äôre talking about PhD students, university professors, or seasoned professionals in the tech industry. These aren‚Äôt casual viewers you can retain just by posting regularly. Their expectations are high, and they already know a lot, so it takes real depth and value to keep them engaged.\n\nWhy Getting Monetized is Important\nEarning money allows you to keep doing what you love, creating content around scientific programming. But if it doesn‚Äôt generate enough income, reality kicks in, and you‚Äôre forced to shift your time toward something more financially sustainable. In a niche with a small, highly intelligent audience, you often have to invest significantly more time and effort into producing complex content, only to earn far less than creators in broader, more popular niches on YouTube."

    "text": "The Growth: A Slow, Steady Climb\nI won‚Äôt lie, starting a YouTube channel is a slow grind, especially in a niche like computational science. I celebrated my first 100 subscribers like I‚Äôd won a Nobel Prize. I saw some growth from tutorials and coding deep dives, and even got great comments from viewers who found the content genuinely helpful.\nBut while subscriber numbers were growing slowly, watch hours became the bottleneck. After two years, I‚Äôm still stuck at around 3,000 watch hours, well below the 4,000 required for monetization.\n\n\n\nStuck at 3K Watch Hours, and It‚Äôs Been a Full Year"

The momentum I had built up through long-form educational content hit a wall. YouTube‚Äôs focus had clearly shifted: Shorts were getting the spotlight, and deep-dive videos like mine were left behind in the algorithmic shadow.\nI put out a few more videos, but even my top-performing ones weren‚Äôt getting any views anymore! The engagement wasn‚Äôt the same. My audience came for depth, not speed. And it turns out, that‚Äôs a tough sell in a platform now optimized for swipeable soundbites."

    "text": "Reaching More Viewers\nI‚Äôll be honest with you, I‚Äôm fully capable of creating videos on complex topics in programming and mathematics. But there‚Äôs a real issue. YouTube‚Äôs algorithm just doesn‚Äôt seem to favor content even remotely close to my niche, and I honestly don‚Äôt know why. So after spending hours crafting detailed scripts, designing slides, and doing heavy editing, the final video ends up with barely 200 views. It‚Äôs disheartening, to say the least.\nI know it might sound like I‚Äôm fixated on view counts, but let‚Äôs be honest, everyone wants their videos to be seen by more people, and I‚Äôm no exception. I‚Äôm fully aware that the videos I‚Äôve made aren‚Äôt necessarily groundbreaking or impossible for others to create. Still, each one takes a lot of time and energy to produce, and that effort makes it tough when they go mostly unnoticed."

    "text": "Lessons They Don‚Äôt Tell You\nIronically, the videos that go viral1 on your channel can end up hurting it in the long run. Why? Because the more views a video gets, the more subscribers you gain, but there‚Äôs a catch. Most of those new subscribers came for that one specific topic. So when you publish your next video, chances are they‚Äôre not interested. They don‚Äôt watch, like, or engage with it, and that lack of interaction signals to the algorithm that your content isn‚Äôt worth pushing, effectively killing the video right out of the gate. This experience has been humbling, but also deeply educational. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:\n\nYou can grow a channel fairly easily within a niche. But if the audience size is small, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll never get monetized or earn a sustainable income from it.\nYouTube rewards quantity, not necessarily quality. A 20-minute, carefully crafted tutorial might get outranked by a 15-second meme.\nDiscoverability in niche topics is hard. Even good content needs luck or algorithmic blessings (Whatever that means!) to surface.\nThe grind is real. Scriptwriting, editing, thumbnails, SEO, comments, it‚Äôs a full-time job without the pay (yet).\nBut consistency builds skill. I‚Äôm a better communicator, editor, and teacher now than I was two years ago."
